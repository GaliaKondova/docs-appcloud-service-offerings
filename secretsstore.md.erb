## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Secrets Store is a marketplace service and allows for developers to store credentials in JSON format securely that applications can use. In comparison to providing credentials with environment variables (e.g. with cf set-env), credentials stored in Secrets Store are not visible as environment variables reducing the exposure of sensitive information.

After the [creation](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#create) and the [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) of the service to the application, the environment variable [VCAP_SERVICES](../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) is created. Information about the credentials are stored in this variable as shown here:

```json
{
  "secret1": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "credhub-ref": "/swisscom-service-broker/credhub/d8cea96f-beed-4e7e-b757-593ca84628e4/credentials"
    },
    "instance_name": "creds",
    "label": "secret1",
    "name": "creds",
    "plan": "basic",
    "tags": []
   }
  ]
 }
```

A `"credhub-ref"` will be visible in `cf env` and the container environment variables, but can only be interpolated by the application.

As you would with any other [VCAP_SERVICES](../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES), you can read the `"credentials"` key to retrieve your credentials.
