## <a id='integrating-your-service'></a> Integrating the Service With Your App

After the [creation](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#create) of the service and the [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) of the service to the application, the environment variable [VCAP_SERVICES](../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) is created. Information about the credentials are stored in this variable as shown here:

```JSON
{
  "redis": [
   {
      "credentials": {
        "host": "v47n9xwgdgq1cejy.service.consul",
        "password": "okX21RG85anPfDJa",
        "port": 35719
      },
      "label": "redis",
      "name": "redis-example",
      "plan": "small",
      "tags": []
    }
  ]
}
```
