## <a id='integrating-your-service'></a> Integrating the Service With Your App

After the [creation](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#create) of the service and the [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) of the service to the application, the environment variable [VCAP_SERVICES](../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) is created. Information about the credentials are stored in this variable as shown here:

```JSON
{
  "mariadb": [
    {
      "credentials": {
        "database": "CF",
        "database_uri": "mysql://h0RG2:Fvoz@10.0.0.7:3336/CF?reconnect=true",
        "host": "10.0.0.7",
        "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql://10.0.0.7:3336/CF",
        "name": "CF",
        "password": "Fvoz",
        "port": 3336,
        "uri": "mysql://h0RG2:Fvoz@10.0.0.7:3336/CF?reconnect=true",
        "username": "h0RG2"
      },
      "label": "mariadb",
      "name": "testmaria",
      "plan": "small",
      "tags": []
    }
  ]
}
```
