## <a id='integrating-your-service'></a> Integrating the Service With Your App

After the [creation](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#create) of the service and the [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) of the service to the application, the environment variable [VCAP_SERVICES](../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) is created. Information about the credentials are stored in this variable as shown here:

```json

  "mariadb": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "database": "CF",
     "database_uri": "mysql://h0RG2:FvozC@10.0.0.7:3306/CF?reconnect=true",
     "host": "10.0.0.7",
     "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql://10.0.0.7:3306/CF?user=h0RG2\u0026password=FvozC",
     "name": "CF",
     "password": "FvozC",
     "port": 3306,
     "uri": "mysql://h0RG2:FvozC@10.0.0.7:3306/CF?reconnect=true",
     "username": "h0RG2"
    },
    "label": "mariadb",
    "name": "testmariadb",
    "plan": "small",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [],
    "volume_mounts": []
   }
  ]
```

<p class="note">
Please be aware that the number of concurrent connections to MariaDB is limited depending on the service plan you chose. You can manage this by using connection pooling.

## <a id='service-connector'></a> Administrating your MariaDB instances

To connect to a running MariaDB instance with your local development tools, you can use the Swisscom [Service Connector](../service-connector/index.html) plugin for the Cloud Foundry CLI.

## <a id='sample-application'></a> Sample Application

Cloud Foundry: [Spring Music Example](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music)

## <a id='limitations'></a> Known Limitations

Our HA MariaDB offering is based on Galera cluster, which brings some [known limitations](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-galera-cluster-known-limitations/) with it.

Our Galera aaS is a shared Galera cluster. Each customer has their own database (`CREATE DATABSE`) with all privileges.

```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `CF_DATABASE_NAME`.* TO 'USER'@'SUBNET'
```

## <a id='definer'></a> Definer and bind-service (Credentials changing)

With `cf bind-service` the service broker (Cloud Foundry component) creates new credentials for security reasons (`cf env APP_NAME` to view them). This will break existing routines, triggers, views and events because they are still using the old user.

Error Code from MariaDB backend:

```
Error: 1449 SQLSTATE: HY000 (ER_NO_SUCH_USER)
Message: The user specified as a definer ('%s'@'%s') does not exist
```

See MariaDB Blog post [Changing the DEFINER of MySQL stored routines etc.](https://mariadb.com/resources/blog/changing-definer-mysql-stored-routines-etc) for ideas how to fix this.
