## <a id='integrating-your-service'></a> Integrating the Service With Your App

After the [creation](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#create) of the service and the [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) of the service to the application, the environment variable [VCAP_SERVICES](../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) is created. Information about the credentials are stored in this variable as shown here:

```json
{
  "mariadb": [
    {
      "credentials": {
        "database": "CF",
        "database_uri": "mysql://h0RG2:Fvoz@10.0.0.7:3336/CF?reconnect=true",
        "host": "10.0.0.7",
        "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql://10.0.0.7:3336/CF",
        "name": "CF",
        "password": "Fvoz",
        "port": 3336,
        "uri": "mysql://h0RG2:Fvoz@10.0.0.7:3336/CF?reconnect=true",
        "username": "h0RG2"
      },
      "label": "mariadb",
      "name": "testmaria",
      "plan": "small",
      "tags": []
    }
  ]
}
```

<p class="note">
Please be aware that the number of concurrent connections to MariaDB is limited depending on the service plan you chose. You can manage this by using connection pooling.

## <a id='service-connector'></a> Administrating your MariaDB instances

To connect to a running MariaDB instance with your local development tools, you can use the Swisscom [Service Connector](../service-connector/index.html) plugin for the Cloud Foundry CLI.

## <a id='sample-application'></a> Sample Application

Cloud Foundry: [Spring Music Example](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music)

## <a id='limitations'></a> Known Limitations

The base of our HA MariaDB offering is built by a Galera cluster, which brings some [known limitations](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-galera-cluster-known-limitations/) with it.

Our Galera aaS is a shared Galera cluster. Each customer have their own Database (`CREATE DATABSE`) with rights inside their own database.

## <a id='definer'></a> Definer and bind-service (Credentials changing)

With `cf bind-service` the service broker creates new credentials (`cf env $APP` to view them). This will break Routines, Triggers, Views and Events because they still have the old user hardcoded.

Error Code:

```
Error: 1449 SQLSTATE: HY000 (ER_NO_SUCH_USER)
Message: The user specified as a definer ('%s'@'%s') does not exist
```

See MariaDB Blog posting [Changing the DEFINER of MySQL stored routines etc.](https://mariadb.com/resources/blog/changing-definer-mysql-stored-routines-etc) for ideas howto fix this.
