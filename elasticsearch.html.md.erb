## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Elasticsearch is a powerful open-source search engine for full text search.

## <a id='integrating-your-service'></a> Integrating the Service With Your App

After the [creation](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#create) of the service and the [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) of the service to the application, the environment variable [VCAP_SERVICES](../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) is created. This variable stores information about the credentials as shown here:

```json
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "elasticsearch": [
   {
    "binding_name": null,
    "credentials": {
     "full_access_password": "password",
     "full_access_username": "username",
     "host": "https://d15c5caa5a3147ed9b444e4694162b3f.elasticsearch.lyra-836.appcloud.swisscom.com",
     "kibana_read_only_password": "password",
     "kibana_read_only_username": "username",
     "ece_kibana_dashboard_only_username": "username",
     "ece_kibana_dashboard_only_password": "password",
     "kibana_system_password": "password",
     "kibana_system_username": "username",
     "logstash_system_password": "password",
     "logstash_system_username": "username"
    },
    "instance_name": "elasticsearch-service",
    "label": "elasticsearch",
    "name": "elasticsearch-service",
    "plan": "xxsmall",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [
     "elasticsearch"
    ],
    "volume_mounts": []
   }
  ]
 }
}

```

## <a id='privileges'></a> User Privileges

Each [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) comes with a set of five users with different privileges.

- `kibana_read_only_username`: a user which has read access to Kibana. This user should be used when giving access to your Kibana.
- `kibana_dashboard_only_username`: a user which has the `kibana_dashboard_only_role` assigned and can only access dashboards in Kibana.
- `full_access_username`: a user which has read and write access to all indices. This user is optimal for integration with your application.
- `kibana_system_username`: a system user for the Kibana application.
- `logstash_system_username`: a system user for the Logstash application

## <a id='versions'></a> Versions

For the Elasticsearch service multiple versions are available.
Currently available versions:

- 6.8.2
- 7.0.1
- 7.1.1
- 7.2.1
- 7.3.1 (default)

To create a cluster with a specific version you must provide the version (from the list above) as a parameter. E.g.:

`cf create-service elasticsearch xxsmall <my-elasticsearch> -c '{"version":"X.Y.Z"}'`

Or you can update any existing service by using the update-service command. E.g.:

`cf update-service <service-name> -c '{"version":"X.Y.Z"}'`

*Note*: when using a custom Elasticsearch version you must specify the version on all `cf update-service` calls.
Otherwise, we will use the default version.


## <a id='version-upgrade'></a> Version Upgrade

New versions of Elasticsearch will be announced in the newsletter as soon as they are available.

The upgrade to the new version is done through the CF CLI by running the update service command.

`cf update-service <service-name> -c '{"version":"X.Y.Z"}'`

### Upgrade to Elasticsearch version 7.x

Before you can upgrade to the latest major release of Elasticsearch (version 7) you must check for any incompatibilities of your existing indices.
We recommend first upgrading to the latest minor release of Elasticsearch version 6 (currently version 6.8.2) and then upgrade to version 7.x.
Currently the upgrade assistant is not available.

## <a id='plan-upgrade'></a> Plan Upgrade

Elasticsearch service can be upgraded to larger plans (downgrading to smaller plans is not possible).

The upgrade to a larger plan is done through the CF CLI by running the update service command.

`cf update-service <service-name> -p <new-plan-name>`

*Note*: if you use a different Elasticsearch version than the default you must specify that version as well.
Otherwise, we will use the default version.

`cf update-service <service-name> -p <new-plan-name> -c '{"version":"X.Y.Z"}'`

## <a id='x-pack'></a> X-Pack

Our Elasticsearch service comes with X-Pack preinstalled and activated. The X-Pack license fee is included in the price.

## <a id='kibana'></a> Kibana

We have deprecated the Kibana buildpack with the release of cflinuxfs3 (Ubuntu 18).

You can find a guide on how to set up Kibana with Docker here: [Kibana Docker](./kibana-docker.html)

## <a id='logstash'></a> Logstash

We have deprecated the Logstash buildpack with the release of cflinuxfs3 (Ubuntu 18).

You can find a guide on how to set up Logstash with Docker here: [Logstash Docker](./logstash-docker.html)

## <a id='curator'></a> Curator

Current versions of ElasticSearch (6.7+) offer [Index Lifecycle Management](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-index-lifecycle-management.html) as alternative to Curator.

For older versions, use [cf-curator-cron](https://github.com/swisscom/cf-curator-cron) as workaround to periodically clean up your Indices.

## <a id='highavailablility'></a> High Availability

The Elasticsearch cluster consists of 3 nodes in 3 different availability zones. By default, each index in Elasticsearch has 5 primary shards and 1 replica allocated to it. If you donâ€™t want to use the default settings, make sure to configure the number of shards & replicas accordingly in the index templates. Swisscom cannot guarantee the availability of your data unless you configure at least one replica.

## <a id='backups'></a> Backups

If you want to create backups there is an app available that allows for automatic scheduled backups: [backman - the appcloud backup manager](https://github.com/swisscom/backman).
Any Elasticsearch service instance bound to this app will be automatically backed up, can be downloaded and also restored on-demand.
