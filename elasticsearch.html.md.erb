Elasticsearch is a powerful open-source search engine for full text search.

## <a id='integrating-your-service'></a> Integrating the Service With Your App

After the [creation](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#create) of the service and the [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) of the service to the application, the environment variable [VCAP_SERVICES](../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) is created. Information about the credentials are stored in this variable as shown here:

```json
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "elasticsearch": [
   {
    "binding_name": null,
    "credentials": {
     "full_access_password": "sBBpCWY8aSNZ53R0",
     "full_access_username": "eslB7cbcoW68wM7orP",
     "host": "https://d15c5caa5a3147ed9b9e3e4694162b3f.elasticsearch.lyra-836.appcloud.swisscom.com",
     "kibana_read_only_password": "v1ZNnxh1kkUqyxkR",
     "kibana_read_only_username": "kro7V1B1FS0Hw3gJPeT",
     "kibana_system_password": "I5Uwt7M2IHdQo8mP",
     "kibana_system_username": "ksrh817DjDmHCkiFnX",
     "logstash_system_password": "cfvVs0Vto2wt9V9L",
     "logstash_system_username": "lsE9steNcerSqJNQ38"
    },
    "instance_name": "elasticsearch-service",
    "label": "elasticsearch",
    "name": "elasticsearch-service",
    "plan": "xxsmall",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [
     "elasticsearch"
    ],
    "volume_mounts": []
   }
  ]
 }
}

```

## <a id='privileges'></a> User Privileges

Each [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) comes with a set of four users with different privileges.

- `kibana_read_only_username`: a user which has read access to Kibana. This user should be used when giving access to you Kibana.
- `full_access_username`: a user which has read and write access to all indices. This user is optimal for integration with your appication.
- `kibana_system_username`: a system user for the Kibana application.
- `logstash_system_username`: a system user for the Logstash application

## <a id='x-pack'></a> X-Pack

Our Elasticsearch service comes with X-Pack preinstalled and activated. The X-Pack license fee is included in the price.

## <a id='kibana'></a> Kibana

Starting a Kibana for your service is very simple. Just push an App with the [Kibana buildpack](https://github.com/swisscom/kibana-buildpack).
A guide on how to set up your Kibana: [Elasticsearch Buildpacks](./elasticsearch-buildpacks.html)

## <a id='logstash'></a> Logstash

Starting a Logstash for your service is very simple. Just push an app with the [Logstash buildpack](https://github.com/swisscom/logstash-buildpack).

## <a id='curator'></a> Curator

Curator is integrated into the [Logstash buildpack](https://github.com/swisscom/logstash-buildpack).

## <a id='highavailablility'></a> High Availability

The Elasticsearch cluster consists of 3 nodes in 3 different availability zones. By default, each index in Elasticsearch has 5 primary shards and 1 replica allocated to it. If you donâ€™t want to use the default settings, make sure to configure the number of shards & replicas accordingly in the index templates. Swisscom cannot guarantee the availability of your data unless you configure at least one replica.
