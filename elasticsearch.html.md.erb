## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Elasticsearch is a powerful open-source search engine for full text search.

## <a id='integrating-your-service'></a> Integrating the Service With Your App

After the [creation](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#create) of the service and the [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) of the service to the application, the environment variable [VCAP_SERVICES](../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) is created. This variable stores information about the credentials as shown here:

```json
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "elasticsearch": [
   {
    "binding_name": null,
    "credentials": {
     "full_access_password": "password",
     "full_access_username": "username",
     "host": "https://d15c5caa5a3147ed9b444e4694162b3f.elasticsearch.lyra-836.appcloud.swisscom.com",
     "kibana_read_only_password": "password",
     "kibana_read_only_username": "username",
     "kibana_system_password": "password",
     "kibana_system_username": "username",
     "logstash_system_password": "password",
     "logstash_system_username": "username"
    },
    "instance_name": "elasticsearch-service",
    "label": "elasticsearch",
    "name": "elasticsearch-service",
    "plan": "xxsmall",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [
     "elasticsearch"
    ],
    "volume_mounts": []
   }
  ]
 }
}

```

## <a id='privileges'></a> User Privileges

Each [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) comes with a set of four users with different privileges.

- `kibana_read_only_username`: a user which has read access to Kibana. This user should be used when giving access to your Kibana.
- `full_access_username`: a user which has read and write access to all indices. This user is optimal for integration with your appication.
- `kibana_system_username`: a system user for the Kibana application.
- `logstash_system_username`: a system user for the Logstash application

## <a id='x-pack'></a> X-Pack

Our Elasticsearch service comes with X-Pack preinstalled and activated. The X-Pack license fee is included in the price.

## <a id='kibana'></a> Kibana

We have deprecated the [Kibana buildpack](https://github.com/swisscom/kibana-buildpack) with the release of cflinuxfs3 (Ubuntu 18).

You can find a guide on how to set up Kibana with Docker here: [Kibana Docker](./kibana-docker.html)

## <a id='logstash'></a> Logstash

We have deprecated the [Logstash buildpack](https://github.com/swisscom/kibana-buildpack) with the release of cflinuxfs3 (Ubuntu 18).

You can find a guide on how to set up Logstash with Docker here: [Logstash Docker](./logstash-docker.html)

## <a id='curator'></a> Curator

Curator is integrated into the [Logstash buildpack](https://github.com/swisscom/logstash-buildpack).

## <a id='highavailablility'></a> High Availability

The Elasticsearch cluster consists of 3 nodes in 3 different availability zones. By default, each index in Elasticsearch has 5 primary shards and 1 replica allocated to it. If you donâ€™t want to use the default settings, make sure to configure the number of shards & replicas accordingly in the index templates. Swisscom cannot guarantee the availability of your data unless you configure at least one replica.
